We used the following libraries in this project:
<b>1. axios</b> - we can use fetch as well 
<b>2. bcryptjs</b> - to encrypt the password and then store to databas, also used to create a token as well
<b>3. jsonwebtoken</b> - securely sending a token and not to be stored in the local storage. We will be sending and securing the cookies from the server side so that it doesn't get manipulated on the front-end side and for this we will need a jsonwebtoken
<b>4. nodemailer - use to shoot out an email from gmail, aws or anything</b> 
<b>5. react-hot-toast - for pop-up messages </b>
<b>6. mongoose - help us to talk to mango db. It's a wrapper around mango db drivers</b>
